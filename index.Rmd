I am currently a postdoctoral research associate for the [Centre for Early Mathematics Learning](https://ceml.ac.uk) in the Department of Mathematics Education, Loughborough University. I am a mixed methods researcher with a philosophy embedded in methodological pragmatism. I am also an invited editorial advisory board member for the *International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology*.

<h3 style="margin:20px, 0, 0, 0;">Research Interests</h3>
My main research interests are the educational research practice gap, mathematics textbooks, and mathematical reading. 

<h4 style="margin:20px, 0, 0, 0;">The Educational Research-Practice Gap</h4>
My postdoctoral role predominantly involves investigating how we can improve the effectiveness of communication between researchers and practitioners, working with a team of researchers from Loughborough University, UCL, and the University of Bristol. 

Some of our projects include: (1) framing the research-practice journey, collating research and posing questions to support researchers with creating impact ([Howard-Jones, Woollacott & Gilmore, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/02607476.2024.2432942)), (2) creating a programme of research exploring the efficacy of summaries of educational research (e.g., [Woollacott, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1002/rev3.70032)), and (3) investigating the barriers that educators face when engaging with research ([Woollacott, Guy & Lortie-Forgues, under review]()).

<h4 style="margin:20px, 0, 0, 0;">Mathematics Textbooks</h4>
Mathematics textbooks were the topic of my PhD thesis (an ESRC-funded collaborative studentship with Oxford University Press). I investigated the under-researched area of students' and authors' perceptions of college-level mathematics textbooks in England, using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and reflexive thematic analysis. I then focussed on mathematical textbook design, using eye-tracking technology and comparative judgement. 

For more detail, you can find my thesis [here](https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Reading_mathematics_a_textbook_approach/22341706?file=39753043) or in [Woollacott, Alcock & Inglis (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14794802.2022.2158122) and [Woollacott, Alcock & Inglis (under review)]().

<h4 style="margin:20px, 0, 0, 0;">Mathematical Reading</h4>
I became interested in mathematical reading during my doctoral research investigating mathematics textbooks. I interviewed and surveyed English college-level students, finding that their self-reported use of their textbook exposition was much higher than anticipated from the existing literature ([Wang, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/00220272.2021.1941265), [Pepin & Haggarty, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02656616)). Delving deeper, I found a wealth of research discussing the complexity of reading mathematical texts, and the expectation that students would struggle with mathematical reading. 

This led to a programme of research using eye-tracking technology to investigate the cognitive reading processes in mathematics (e.g., [Woollacott & Strohmaier, in press]()). I also regularly give invited practitioner-facing workshops discussing the importance of mathematical reading (see [here](https://lboro.ac.uk/services/lumen/professional-development/reading-maths-is-hard)) and I am currently investigating mathematical oracy in a related research project.

<h3 style="margin:20px, 0, 0, 0;">Additional Interests</h3>

I am a freelance **educational consultant** and have worked with publishers to support their educational STEM resources. Please get in touch if you think I might be able to help you.

I established and led an **Academic Writing Workshop** for the Department of Mathematics Education, Loughborough University (2019--2025). With undergraduate in mathematics, one of the hardest learning curves when entering academia was learning how to write academically. After reading Barbara Sarnecka's *[The Writing Workshop](https://osf.io/n8pc3/)*, I established our department's writing workshop, hoping to create a supportive writing community and improve my academic writing. Over the years, the workshop has grown from strength to strength and is now a permanent feature of our department. Our writing community is something that I am extremely proud of, and our weekly sessions give everyone a chance to dedicate time for writing. I have led various academic writing skills sessions over the years and I am very happy to share resources and tips for anyone intending to set-up something similar in their department.

From 2022--2025, I was the **Director of the Centre for Mathematical Cognition blog** at Loughborough University. This involved leading all aspects of the blog's strategy, content and delivery, editing colleagues' submissions for a public, wide-ranging audience. You can find the blog [here](https://blog.lboro.ac.uk/cmc/).

I also hold a **Level 2 BTEC in Mental Health Awareness** ensuring that I am prepared to support the emotional and mental wellbeing of my colleagues -- something which I believe is extremely important.
